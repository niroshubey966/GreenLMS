<div id="Demo1" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>There are more than 100 different open days and events in Cambridge organised by the University and the Colleges throughout the year. These include the Cambridge Open Day, College open days, Department open days and specialist open days.<br><br>

<button onclick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">What courses are available at Cambridge?</button>
<div id="Demo2" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>At Cambridge we have full-time undergraduate courses ranging from Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic to Veterinary Medicine, and lots in between.

Many of our courses encompass several subjects, with some options available in a number of courses where the subjects overlap. This offers much greater flexibility than more narrowly focused courses elsewhere. Those with a clear sense of the subject they wish to pursue at university can specialise. However, students who are less certain are able to explore the wider subject area before deciding what to focus on. 
 list of all the courses available can be found on the course index page</p>

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo3')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">What is a College?</button>
<div id="demo3" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>As well as being members of the University, our students are also a member of College. A College is where you'll be based for the time you're studying at the University of Cambridge, and while the Colleges provide student accommodation they are much more than halls of residence. Colleges are responsible for admitting students, and they also organise ‘supervisions’ (small-group teaching sessions that support the lectures and practicals that you attend).

For more information about the College system at Cambridge, and profiles on each of the 29 undergraduate Colleges, have a look at Colleges.</p>
</div>
</div>
      
<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo4')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">How do I choose a College?</button>
<div id="demo4" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>    
It might seem a bit daunting trying to choose a College, but don't worry, Colleges are more alike than they are different! Students on the same course, regardless of their College, are taught together by the academic faculties/departments, and our cross-College moderation procedures mean that your choice of College does not affect your chances of being made an offer. The key functions that the University and Colleges are responsible for are outlined in Cambridge Explained.

When choosing a College, we suggest you consider the following:

course – most Colleges take students in all subjects, but there are a handful that don't so check availability (details can be found in the relevant course entries and College profiles)
your age – four Colleges are exclusively for mature students (aged 21 or older), and their facilities are geared accordingly
your gender – three Colleges consider applications from female students only.
College size – number of students
appearance and type of accommodation (eg on-site or College-owned houses)
particular facilities
personal instinct – many students can't explain why they were drawn to their College other than it just 'felt right' for them
It can be helpful to make a shortlist of perhaps half a dozen Colleges based on their profiles and then either contact the Colleges for further information or arrange a visit. Each College has a profile (including links to their own websites).
    
    While your College organises your supervisions, contrary to what some people believe, the research specialisms of a College’s Fellows won’t dictate what you can study or guarantee you’ll be supervised by them. If a Fellow of your College is an expert in the aspects of the course you’ve chosen, you may be supervised by them. However, you’ll attend supervisions at another College is that’s where the relevant subject expert is based.

Teaching is a level playing field across the University and is not determined by the College you attend – the differences between the Colleges lie in the ambience, not the educational opportunities.

The key functions that the University and Colleges are responsible for are outlined in Cambridge Explained.
    
Guidance on how (and how not) to choose a College can be found in Choosing a College.</p>

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo5')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Will choosing a preference College or an open application affect my chances of being made an offer?</button>
<div id="demo5" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p> 
      
For equally well-qualified students, making an open application or applying to a specific College makes no difference to your chances of being made an offer.

Don’t agonise over choosing a College, students quickly settle in and really enjoy their College, wherever they end up! Each year, around 850 applicants are made an offer through the pool system by a different College to the one they originally applied/were allocated to – that’s about 25 per cent of all offers made.</p>
</div>
</div>
      
      
<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo6')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">    Can I choose more than one College?</button>
<div id="demo6" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>  
No – you can only make one application to the University, either selecting a preference College or an open application. Applications to more than one College, or to one College and an open application are not allowed. In addition, once you’ve submitted your application, you cannot change this choice.</p>

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo7')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align"> How do I apply?</button>
<div id="demo7" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>     
The application process is really quite straightforward. To apply to the University of Cambridge you need to submit a UCAS application online by 15 October the year before you wish to start at the University.
    
    Applicants living in countries outside the EU are also asked to submit a Cambridge Online Preliminary Application Form (COPA).

Once you have submitted your UCAS Application (and COPA, if required) you will also be asked to complete a Supplementary Application Questionnaire (SAQ).

If you want to know what happens to your application once it is submitted, the ‘Applying’ section of our website has all the details. 
      When is the application deadline?
The deadline for your UCAS application is 15 October.

Slightly earlier deadlines affect applicants for Organ Scholarships and some applicants wishing to be interviewed overseas.

There is also a later deadline for some mature applicants applying to one of the mature Colleges – see the mature students section for more information.

A useful summary of important dates and deadlines can be found in the Applying section.</p>
</div>      
</div>
      
<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo8')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">  What should a personal statement include?</button>
<div id="demo8" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>      
   
Your personal statement is your opportunity to tell the universities you’re applying to about your subject interest(s) and why you’d be a good student of that subject. The process of writing your personal statement can also help you to better understand your academic interests and motivations.

UCAS provide advice about what to include in your personal statement and you should refer to their website in the first instance. Your school/college may also be able to offer advice about what to include.

At Cambridge, all admissions decisions are based solely on academic criteria – ability and potential. Therefore, in their personal statement, we’re looking for applicants to:

explain their reasons for wanting to study the subject at university
demonstrate enthusiasm for and commitment to their chosen course
express any particular interests(s) within the field
outline how they’ve pursued their interest in the subject in their own time
Such information is often used as a basis for discussion at interview (if interviewed).

If you wish to make any comments that are particularly relevant to your Cambridge application (eg to highlight particular features of the Cambridge course that attracted you), you have the opportunity to include an additional personal statement in your SAQ. This is optional and you won’t be disadvantaged if you have nothing to add in this section of the SAQ. As we’ll already have received a copy of it, you shouldn’t repeat information provided in your UCAS personal statement in the SAQ.</p>
</div>

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo9')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Can I take a gap year and defer my entry?</button>
<div id="demo9" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>  

About one in ten students coming to Cambridge takes a gap year before starting their studies. This year out is a very useful time in which to improve skills, earn money, travel and generally gain maturity and self-reliance.

You should state on your UCAS application if you wish to defer entry. You’ll probably be asked about your plans at interview, so be prepared to talk about your year out.

If you’re applying for Mathematics, most Colleges have a preference for immediate entry. However, if you’re applying for Engineering many Colleges generally prefer applicants to take a year out, to gain some industrial experience. Please note that it’s not possible to defer entry for the Graduate Course in Medicine.</p>
</div>    
</div>
      
<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo10')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Will I be interviewed?</button>
<div id="demo10" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
Everyone with a realistic chance of being offered a place is invited to attend an interview – that's around 80 per cent of applicants. So, if you apply, it is very likely that you will be invited to Cambridge for an admissions interview (although due to the level of competition for places, there are applicants each year who are not interviewed).

Interviews usually take place in Cambridge during the first three weeks of December, so we strongly advise you not to make unbreakable commitments for this period. Some applicants may be interviewed overseas for which an earlier application deadline and interview period may apply.

Not all applicants who are interviewed will be successful (made an offer of a place), but all those who are made an offer will have been interviewed.

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo11')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Will I have to sit a written assessment?</button>
<div id="demo11" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
You will be required to sit a written assessment (with the exception of applicants to Mathematics and Music) either pre-interview or at-interview. If your course has a pre-interview assessment you will need to register by 15 October. If your course has an at-interview assessment your College will make the arrangements, usually for the same day as your interview(s).</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('demo12')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">What's the most important part of my application?</button>
<div id="demo12" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>

Every application is assessed holistically – Admissions Tutors consider all of the information available together before making any decisions.

No part of an application is considered in isolation; for example, a student’s performance at interview alone doesn’t determine the outcome of their application.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="lmscontainer">      
<button onclick="myFunction('demo13')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align"> What work experience do I need to have?</button>
<div id="demo13" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
     
Work experience isn't expected or required. However, for vocational courses, such as Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, having some relevant work experience in an appropriate setting is useful and recommended. It demonstrates commitment to your intended profession and gives you the opportunity to acquire greater understanding of the realities and pressures associated with that career.
      What extra-curricular activities will help my chances of admission?
Our admissions decisions are based on academic criteria (ability and potential) and so we expect to see evidence you your ‘super-curricular’ activities – your wider engagements with the area(s) of academic interest, such as reading and other explorations relevant to the course you’ve applied for.

Your participation (or not) in specific extra-curricular activities that aren’t relevant to the course applied for are not taken into account and don’t affect your chances of being made an offer of a place at Cambridge.

However, when composing your personal statement, you should consider the importance that your other university choices may place on extra-curricular activities.</p>

<div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo14')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">     Can I transfer to Cambridge from another university?</button>
<div id="demo14" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
 
Cambridge Colleges will only, as a matter of principle, consider applications from students enrolled in a degree course at other UK universities in very exceptional circumstances.

Any application to study at Cambridge would need strong support from your Course Director or other academic tutor at your current university. A reference or letter of recommendation from that person to the Cambridge College would be required, and only then can a Cambridge College consider an application. All such applications are still subject to the same academic assessment as any other application to the University.

We do have a system of admitting graduates from other universities to do a second undergraduate degree as an affiliated student at Cambridge, in which case the course takes a year less than usual.</p>
</div>

<div class="lmscontainer">
    <button onclick="myFunction('demo15')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align"> What qualifications are acceptable?</button>
<div id="demo15" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
    
      The majority of applicants apply with A Levels, although other school/national examinations at an equivalent level (such as Scottish Highers and Advanced Highers, Irish Leaving Certificate, Welsh Baccalaureate, French Baccalaureate, German Abitur, Italian Maturita, and International Baccalaureate) are also acceptable. Information about typical requirements for a range of qualifications can be found in Entrance Requirements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="lmscontainer">
    <button onclick="myFunction('demo16')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">  What grades do I need?</button>
<div id="demo16" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
   
Whatever school or college system you are being educated in, we require top grades in the highest level qualifications available for school/college students – most successful applicants to the University ultimately exceed the conditions of their offer.

Please see the entrance requirements for typical requirements for the most common qualifications, or contact the College you are thinking of applying to.</p>
</div>
</div>
    <div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo17')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align"> Are there any subject requirements?</button>
<div id="demo17" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
     
This depends upon the course you are planning to study. For many courses at Cambridge qualifications in certain subjects required and all Colleges expect such subjects to be passed, normally with an A or A* grade at A Level/grade 6 or 7 at Higher Level of the IB (or equivalent). Our other courses don’t have particular subject requirements but Admissions Tutors will expect high grades in the subjects most relevant to the course applied for and expect you to have read enough about the course to know what studying it entails.

Subject requirements and preferences are given in the relevant course entry. Please also check College-specific requirements with the College(s) you’re considering applying to.</p>

        </div>
  <div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo18')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">  What's the University's position on exam resits?</button>
<div id="demo18" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
  
    
While it’s becoming less common to be able to resit exams, should the opportunity be available your application is unlikely to be adversely affected by your resitting one or two modules – we appreciate that even very capable students may have a ‘bad day’ when an exam doesn’t go quite to plan.

However, there would be concern about your potential to be successful at Cambridge if you needed to resit numerous exams, particularly if only a marginal improvement could be achieved. This is because once at the University, students are regularly assessed by exam and there's no opportunity to resit any exams (with the exception of professional qualifying examinations in Medicine and Veterinary Medicine).

You should state your intention to resit any exams in your SAQ. Where there are particular reasons for underperformance in qualifications it’s useful if these can be outlined in the school/college reference. In some cases, it may be appropriate for your school/college referee to complete an Extenuating Circumstances Form.</p>

  <div class="lmscontainer">
<button onclick="myFunction('demo19')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Mature applicants - Do I need to have undertaken some form of recent study?</button>
<div id="demo19" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
     
Every mature applicant is considered on an individual basis allowing personal qualities and experience to be taken into account in the selection process. However, the nature and demands of Cambridge courses mean they do require academic preparation, and mature students must be of an equal academic standard to school leavers. Therefore, you’re expected to demonstrate evidence of recent academic achievement at a high level.

If you are considering applying to Cambridge it's advisable to contact one of the mature Colleges to discuss your circumstances and for advice about academic requirements for the course you wish to take. </p>

    <button onclick="myFunction('demo20')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Are there any bursaries or scholarships available?</button>
<div id="demo20" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
      
Yes. Cambridge is fortunate to have a large amount of financial support available for its students. First of all there is the Cambridge Bursary Scheme for UK/EU students, offering bursaries of up to £3,500 a year (up to £5,600 per year for some mature students and care leavers). Colleges also offer financial support to students, and there are additional awards available for outstanding sportspeople, musicians and students with a disability.

<button onclick="myFunction('demo21')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">   Mature applicants - Is the application process the same for mature applicants?</button>
<div id="demo21" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
   
Mature applicants need to submit a UCAS application online just like standard age applicants.

If you're applying from a country outside the EU, you should also submit a Cambridge Online Preliminary Application (COPA). Those applying for the Graduate Course in Medicine need to complete an additional form as well.

The standard application deadline is 15 October. However, the four mature Colleges consider mature and affiliate applications in some subjects as part of a second applications round.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('demo22')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align"> Mature applicants - Can I apply to any College?</button>
<div id="demo22" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>
     
Yes. You can apply to any of the 29 undergraduate Colleges. The majority of students are 18 or 19 years old when they start their course, so you may prefer to consider one of the four ‘mature’ Colleges (Hughes Hall, Lucy Cavendish College, St Edmund’s College and Wolfson College) where all students are over 21 years old. Mature students who make an open application are allocated to one of the mature Colleges.</p>

  <p>

If you are a graduate with an approved degree from another university, you can apply to take a Cambridge BA course as an affiliated applicant. This means you could take the degree in a year less than usual.

Most Colleges consider affiliated applicants, but please note that there are some restrictions so please check with the College before submitting your application</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('demo1-1')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">What is Computer Science?</button>
<div id="demo1-1" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>Most people often equate the study of Computer Science to the study of computer programming. Edsger Dijkstra – one of the pioneers of the Computer Science discipline once said, Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. The study of Computer Science encompasses much more than programming and involves a variety of topics such as analysis and design of algorithms, formal design techniques, design of programming languages, software engineering, assembly language and computer organization, distributed computing, artificial intelligence and mathematical analysis. Computer scientists study how to efficiently organize, store and retrieve data, how to write efficient programs, probe the limits of algorithmic techniques in designing programs to behave intelligently, develop new applications that benefit society and humankind, design complex software programs and design effective interfaces between programs and humans.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('demo1-2')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">Is Computer Science the right choice of major for me?</button>
<div id="demo1-2" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>At UALR, we have the Management Information Systems major that is focused on the development of computer applications in a business environment and the effective use of computer resources to meet business objectives. Within our college at UALR, we have an Information Science (IFSC) program where students are primarily concerned with learning about the structure, representation, management, storage, retrieval and transfer of information. Computer Science students on the other-hand focus deeply on the fundamental principles of computing and these students develop skills in data structures, algorithmic reasoning, hardware /software design needs and trade-offs, and integrated software application design. We prepare our students to apply these principles creatively and responsibly. If you are unsure about what area interests you, we suggest that you to try the introductory programming course.

A common misconception among students attracted to the discipline is that they will learn to be skilled web page developers, graphic specialists, or applicative users -word processing, spreadsheet, graphical design, and CAD applications. If your interest is in learning about tools for the creation of computer art, then an art major with a minor in CS or Information Science would be most beneficial. If your interest is in creating efficient software applications, including internetworking software applications for the World Wide Web, then a CS degree with an appropriate minor would be your best option. Please set up a visit and talk to us if your career interests are in the design, analysis and development of software systems.

Also a common expectation (or interest) among some students interested in the discipline is that they will learn to become expert game programmers. While good software design and development skills are key to being a successful game programmer, game programming involves deep knowledge in several other disciplines – including mathematics, psychology and art. Our Graphics, Animation, Multimedia and Entertainment (GAME) option will provide you the necessary basic computing skills – learned through the development of game based assignments and projects. It appropriately blends student learning of computing skills with the required interface development, mathematics and artistic skills to help you begin your career quest as a game programmer.</p>

<div id="demo1-3" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>For almost all choice jobs of the future – whether in engineering, natural or social sciences, economics, finance or government, one has to be familiar with the essential fundamentals of computing to understand and leverage technology in the search for scientific breakthroughs, the development of new products and services, or the way work is done in a technologically-driven society. A Computer Science degree involves well developed communication, leadership and management skills coupled with creative technical savvy. Daniel A. Reed, Professor & Director of the Institute for Renaissance Computing at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the current director of CRA (Computing Research Association – http://www.cra.org) says, “Computing has become the third pillar of science, along with theory and experiment”.olorado.edu.

<div id="demo1-4" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>The introductory courses in Computer Science use C++ and the Windows® operating system environment as the tools to teach basic computer science concepts. Many subsequent courses in computer science assume that you know C++ (or another computer programming language) well and expect you to learn other languages as necessitated by specific problems in those classes.</p>

  <p>Owning a computer is obviously advantageous in terms of ease and convenience to work on your assignments at any given time. However, at UALR we do not require you to have your own computer. In addition to wireless access across the campus, we have many open computer labs for your use, which are equipped with the necessary software for your classes. While some computer labs are devoted to computer science exclusively, others are for the general student population at UALR.

Virtually every industry applies Computer Science professionals in a variety of ways – from computerized control of hazardous and remote environments to payroll processing in traditional industries. Industry, government and businesses seeking graduates in a wide variety of areas including software systems design, internet computing and networking, regularly recruit our graduates. Thus, career opportunities for Computer Science graduates are limitless. We are well known for offering well-designed curricula, setting challenging academic standards and providing well-qualified graduates for businesses and organizations. To support our students’ aspirations of lifelong learning and meet their employers’ needs, in addition to helping develop technical depth in our field, we help our students develop critical thinking, teamwork and effective communication skills.</p>

However, I see that a degree in Computer Science involves a lot of mathematics. Why do you require it?</button>
<div id="demo1-7" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>Most stable and well-paying technology-based jobs require adeptness with algorithmic reasoning. Studying mathematics develops your analytical ability and prepares you to think precisely, thereby preparing you to be creative – a trait essential for being a successful computer scientist. Calculus for example, is not just for engineering students, since it builds in you the ability to think about, and rank the impact of, relationships among different items. The foundations provided by studying mathematics will give you the ability to grasp the essentials of a problem, understand the various abstractions and predict patterns of change induced by changing certain parameters. Such ability is essential to be intellectually productive in your professional life (in any discipline). Note that differences in mathematical performance of students are the result of hard work. Increasingly in this vast technologically glued world, you will experience the need to stand up to theories that do not hold up to quantitative analysis. Hence, the ability in mathematics is definitely helpful. However, it is not the knowledge of mathematics but rather a familiarity and comfort with algorithmic reasoning that correlates with success in the computing discipline.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('demo1-8')" class="lmsbtn lmsblock lmsblack lmsleft-align">What kind of a student succeeds as a Computer Science major?</button>
<div id="demo1-8" class="lmscontainer lmshide">
  <p>Most successful Computer Science students have demonstrated the ability to be flexible and adaptable (i.e. they MORPH well). Specifically, the MORPH traits include: (i) Mature: Clarity of thought (long-term focused career vision). (ii) Organized: Able to manage time and balance personal work habits. (iii) Responsible: Ability to take lead and handle responsibility. (iv) Persistence: Ability to be tenacious and deliberative in problem solving. (v) Helpful: Team-oriented, societal-issues consciousness and supportive of diverse needs and reach of the discipline.

For example, many good students in our upper-level classes have not been the ones that could finish their assignments in lower-level classes on their first attempts, but ones that both made, and learned from, their mistakes through dogged persistence and sheer hard work. One key attribute that most of our successful majors have is the ability to think logically (or in Computer Science parlance, algorithmically). This means developing the ability to break down a problem into a series of small steps each of which can be solved through a logical sequence of actions.</p>
